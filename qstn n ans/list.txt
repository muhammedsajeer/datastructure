LIST

1)Write a program to add only multiples of 3 from the given list.    

        A = [12, 3, 4, 56, 7, 9, 49, 34, 6]

Ans.

A = [12, 3, 4, 56, 7, 9, 49, 34, 6]

s=0

for i in A:

  if i%3==0:

    s=s+i

print(“Sum of all multiples of 3 is “,s)


2) Write a function Lavg(list) in python that takes list as argument and display the average of all 

numbers in the list.

Ans.

A = []

def Lavg(A):

    s=0

    av=0

    for i in A:

        s=s+i

    av=s/len(A)

    print(“Average is “,av)

Lavg([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) #Only to verify the result

3. Write a function double(list) which takes list as argument and multiply each and every 

element of list by 2?                      

Ans.

A = []

def double(A):

    for i in range(len(A)):

        A[i]=A[i]*2

    print(“List is “,A)

double([1,2,3,4,5]) #Only to verify the result


4) Write the output of the following code:                                      

k = “Subscribe to my blog”

L = list(k)

print(L[-1:-7:-3])
print(L[:15:-1])
print(L[1:len(k):5])
print(L[2:-15])



5)Write a program to accept 10 numbers from the user and            

       add even numbers in a list named “evenlist” and odd

      numbers in a list named “oddlist”

6)Write a function evensum(list) in python that takes list of 10      
       numbers as argument and display the sum of all even

       numbers in the list.

7)Write the code to convert the following string into List.              


            “csiplearninghub”

8)Write a program to separate the character and numeric value from a given list and store them in a separate list.

    A = [1,’f’,2,’b’,3,4,’h’,j’,6,9,0,’k’]
