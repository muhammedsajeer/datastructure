1)Write a Python program to print a tuple with string formatting. 
Sample tuple : (100, 200, 300)
Output : This is a tuple (100, 200, 300)

2)Write a Python program to find the repeated items of a tuple.

3)Write a Python program to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples.

4)Modify the first item (22) of a list inside a following tuple to 222
tuple1 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)

Expected output:

tuple1 = (11, [222, 33], 44, 55)

5)Write a Python program to check if a specified element presents in a tuple of tuples

6)Write a Python program convert a given string list to a tuple.

7)Write a Python program to compute element-wise sum of given tuples.
Original lists:
(1, 2, 3, 4)
(3, 5, 2, 1)
(2, 2, 3, 1)
Element-wise sum of the said tuples:
(6, 9, 8, 6)


8)Write a Python program to compute the sum of all the elements of each tuple stored inside a list of tuples.
Original list of tuples:
[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
Sum of all the elements of each tuple stored inside the said list of tuples:
[3, 5, 7]
